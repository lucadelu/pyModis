Example of a full process
===========================

In this short example you can understand how to concatenate
the scripts to obtain a GeoTIFF file for each band of the
chosen product.

.. warning::

  This example is based on a Linux based system. Please if
  you use other OS change the paths where data will be saved


Downloading data
-------------------

For first you need to obtain data, so you need to use :doc:`../scripts/modis_download`

  ::

    modis_download.py -f 2012-12-05 -O -t h28v05,h29v05,h28v04 /tmp

.. warning::

  In this example we are working on Japan extension, so please
  change the name of tiles according with your region.

  In this example we download data for only one day (2012-12-05)
  using the option "-O".

Inside ``/tmp/`` directory you will find a file called *listfileMOD11A1.005.txt*
containing the names of files downloaded. The name of file it is related to
the product that you download.

.. warning::

  Every time that you download new files of same product it will be overwrite,
  so if you need it, you should rename the file

Mosaic data
--------------

At this point you need to create the mosaic of the tiles downloaded.
:doc:`../scripts/modis_mosaic` is the script to use.

::

  modis_mosaic.py -m /path/to/mrt/ -o /tmp/outputfile /tmp/listfileMOD11A1.005.txt

.. warning::

  ``/path/to/mrt/`` is the directory where Modis Reprojection Tools is stored

The output of this command are *outputfile.hdf* and *outputfile.hdf.xml* inside the
directory ``/tmp``. It's reading the input files contained in *listfileMOD11A1.005.txt*

Convert data
---------------

The last part of the procedure is to convert the mosaic, from HDF format and sinusoidal 
projection, to GeoTIFF with several projection. You have to use :doc:`../scripts/modis_convert`

.. only:: html

  ::

    modis_convert.py -s '( 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 )' -m /path/to/mrt/ -o /tmp/finalfile.tif -g 250 /tmp/outputfile.hdf

.. only:: latex

  ::

    modis_convert.py -s '( 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 )' -m /path/to/mrt/ 
		     -o /tmp/finalfile.tif -g 250 /tmp/outputfile.hdf
			 
Extract Quality Information
---------------

If necessary, you can extract specific quality type from the chosen quality layer.
In this particular case, we extract the Mandatory QA flag of the daytime temperature.
You have to use :doc:`../scripts/modis_quality`

::

  modis_quality.py -p MOD11A1 -l 1 -t 1 /tmp/outputfile.hdf /tmp/mod11a1_daytime_qaflag.tif
