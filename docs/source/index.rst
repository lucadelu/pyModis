Welcome to pyModis
===================

``pyModis`` is a Free and Open Source Python based library to work with MODIS data.
It offers bulk-download for user selected time ranges, mosaicking of MODIS tiles,
and the reprojection from Sinusoidal to other projections, convert HDF format to other formats
and the extraction of data quality information.

``pyModis`` library was developed to replace old bash scripts developed by Markus
Neteler to download MODIS data from NASA FTP server. It is very useful for
`GIS and Remote Sensing Platform`_ of `Fondazione Edmund Mach`_ to update 
its large collection of MODIS data.

It has several features:

  - it is very useful for downloading large numbers of MODIS HDF/XML files
    and for using this in a cron job for automated continuous updating; it
    support FTP and HTTP NASA repository

  - it can parse the XML file to obtain information about the HDF files

  - it can convert a HDF MODIS file to GEOTIF file using `MODIS Reprojection Tool`_

  - it can create a mosaic of several tiles using `MODIS Reprojection Tool`_ and can
    create the xml metadata file with the information of all tiles used in mosaic
	
  - it can extract specific information from bit-encoded MODIS quality assesment layers
	of different product types
